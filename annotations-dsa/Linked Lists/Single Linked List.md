Is a collection of nodes that form a linear sequence.

In a Single Linked List, we have just one pointer, that points to next element, and haves a reference to the head element.

Tail node have null as its next reference.

Link Hopping is the same as traversing a linked list.

Implementation of Linked List and basic operations is in `com.eronalves.linkedlist.Single`.
