* Searching a tree is more complicated than searching in a linear data structured
* Trees are non-linear
* Trees are simplier than graphs
* Tree is a type of grpah
* One of the most important nonlinear data structures
* NonLinear: more richer relation than "before" and "after".
* Hierarchical relationship
* Comes from family trees (parent, child, ancestor, descendant)
* Edge: a pair of nodes (u,v) such that u is the parent of v or vice versa
* Path: is a sequence node from u to v
* Depth of Node: number of ancestors of p, other than p itself
* Height of tree: the maximum of the depths of its positions
* A tree is ordered if there is a meaningful linear order among the children of each node
