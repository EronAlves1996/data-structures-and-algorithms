1. Using fixed array capacity (arrayList)
2. Using a dynamic array
	An array is an immutable data structure. A dynamic array should have a capacity higher than the size of the list. If the array reaches its capacity, the class manages to get a new piece of larger space, copying the elements of the older array in this brand new space.
